            Our design problem is that senior public rideshare services are under-utilized and hard to schedule. This problem was inspired by services in our hometowns, particularly the Colts Senior Shared Ride program in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The service is confusing and difficult to apply for. After rides are scheduled, difficulties with confirming and tracking the ride persist. Public rideshare services are under-utilized around the country and these services could give further autonomy to a senior population who already yearns for it. Our solution is a user-friendly way of connecting seniors with rideshare opportunities available to them, allowing them to sign up, schedule rides, and see updates on current rides. This will be an app for smart and flip phones. In our design, we are prioritizing simplicity, readability, and accessibility.

            According to US Aging, 600,000 seniors stop driving every year. Whether this is due to health issues, financial instability, medications, or declining cognitive abilities, these seniors now face social isolation, trouble attending medical appointments, and a push to give up their autonomy and move into nursing homes. About 1,000 rideshare services are available for seniors in the US, according to PubMed Central, but only 15% of seniors use public transportation, according to US Aging. The current system pushes seniors away with its difficulty in finding information, mail-in applications, and inability to track or check on scheduled rides. The current system excels in allowing for seniors to schedule rides ahead of time, allowing for them to reserve a ride to important appointments. By honoring the current system and fixing its problems, we can create a software solution with maximized usability for seniors.
