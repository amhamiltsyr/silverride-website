            The people who might use our design are elderly people with and without disabilities in areas where senior transportation programs exist. These seniors have varying levels of technological knowledge – some may use technology every day while others may struggle to use it. Some may be visually or mentally impaired. These seniors range from age 65 and up and of various races and cultural backgrounds. The senior population may have a variety of mobility abilities, ranging from great mobility to permanent wheelchair users. 
          </p>
          <p class="h3">
            We will use public databases and relevant scientific articles to research the people who might use our design. We chose these methods to get a greater grasp on the overall views of our target population in a simple way. We also chose these specific articles and databases because their information and data was vast while also relating directly to our problem statement.
          </p>
          <p class="h3">
            Specifically, we chose one database and one scientific article. The database was created during a national poll from the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center and tells of the general transportation trends for senior citizens in the US. The scientific article focuses solely on rideshare services for senior citizens and gives detailed statistics of current users including ability levels, cultural backgrounds, and type of rideshare they use.
